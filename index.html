		<p>Mount Royal University's Bachelor of Education — Elementary (B.Ed) is unique in Alberta for providing students with direct entry into the four-year degree program.
             This means you don't need a degree or prior post-secondary coursework to be considered for the program.
             And, starting in your first year of study, you will gain extensive hands-on experience in elementary school classrooms — an experience that continues during each year of the program.
            The Bachelor of Education — Elementary is taught by a committed group of full-time and part-time faculty.
             All full-time faculty members hold PhDs, and have extensive K–12 teaching experience.</p>
