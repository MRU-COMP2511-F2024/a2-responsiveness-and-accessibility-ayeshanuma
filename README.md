# Web Accessibility

document the category of issues that you identified through the manual and automated analysis above:


Through the manual analysis for the web, I realized that the colors of my website could have been with better contrast, as in the blues of varying colors to make the website look more professional. this was also evident in the automated analysis where it showed me that there is very low contrast between text and background colors.


What kinds of changes did you have to make (I do not want a list here).
To improve accessibility, I reviewed the color contrast on the website and identified areas where the contrast was too low for users with visual impairments. I updated several background and text color combinations, choosing darker shades to ensure the text stands out more clearly. These changes help meet WCAG contrast guidelines and make the content more readable for users with low vision.

 Generalize the types of issues that you created when building your website, and then the general type of changes that you made to resolve those issues.

 While building my website, I faced challenges with Responsive Design, particularly making sure it worked well on smaller screens. I had to test and adjust the layout several times, ensuring elements resized and arranged correctly to provide a smooth experience across all devices.

How do these accessibility changes connect with the Gestalt principles we discussed earlier this semester?

figure-ground: Improving color contrast makes it easier to see the difference between the main elements (like text) and the background. This helps users focus on the content clearly and without confusion, creating a strong separation between the two.

continuity: making sure that the website is the same across many different platforms( phones, tablets) makes it easy for the reader to acess the same flow as any other device. 

proximity: A responsive design keeps elements spaced and grouped well, even on small screens. This helps users see related items together and makes the site easier to use. For example the paragraphs part of the same group have lots of proximity to ensure that the reader knows that they belong together. 

similarity: Simple, clear color choices help users see which items go together. This makes it easier to understand and navigate the site. Such as the altering colors in the table helped the user to see and differentitate which portion goes with what. 

closure: Having lots of different layouts and sections allwos the user to see boundaries and what goes where.
